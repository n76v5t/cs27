§ Tasks 3 and 4 can be done at anytime (ie. You don’t need to be in the lab).  Get a head start on them if you have time before the lab!
2. Laboratory Outcomes 
By the end of this lab you should be up to speed and be able:
1. Preform. basic optical test to identify minerals in a thin section
2. Confidently identify all the minerals in the task 3 review chart.
▫ How can we use the lab textbook to help us identify minerals we aren’t familiar with?
3. Identify and describe igneous rocks using the correct terminology
3. Laboratory work and Assignment 
The 4 main tasks to complete this week. You must complete tasks 1 and 2 in the lab and tasks 3 and 4 can be completed before, during or after the lab time. You must hand in Task 1 during your lab, and Task 2 and 3 at the beginning of next week’s lab. Task 2 will be marked, and task 1 and 3 will be marked on a completion basis.  If you do not hand in a completed task 1 and 3, you will receive a mark of zero on task 2. 
The tasks are:
1. Task 1 - Spend time in this lab session making sure you are comfortable preforming the basic optical tests by studying olivine and biotite. This task is described in more detail below. If you have any questions about how to use the microscope and determine these properties, please ask during the lab!
§ Complete the Task 1 and hand it in BEFORE you leave the lab! 
§ Ask Jen/Alex/Jacqueline to check your work! We want to make sure. You are getting the correct answers BEFORE you leave the lab today 
2. Task 2 - Describe the hand samples at the side of the room. Read more about how to classify and describe igneous rocks below. There are four samples, sample numbers 1, 10, 13 and 25. Hand in one hand sample description, either sample number 1, 10 or 25 next week (NOT sample 13!)
§ We have given you the answer key for sample 13 on Learn to give you an idea of how to describe rocks and the level of detail we are looking for.
§ Complete your descriptions for Task 2 in the lab and write it up and hand it in in the beginning of next week’s lab.  
3. Task 3 - Review the 11 minerals listed in the chart for task 3 below and be comfortable identifying them in thin section. You can do this by filling out the chart for task 3 below. 
§ Use your labs from Earth 232, an optical petrology text, or a trusted online source (see the resource module on LEARN) to fill out this chart.
§ This chart will be a great quick reference for you to use during subsequent labs. The more time you spend on it the more useful it will be in the future!!
§ Can use this chart during the lab exam!! (if there are no extra additions/drawings on the page)
§ This can be done at any time.  Hand it in in the beginning of next week’s lab.  
4. Task 4 - Read over the textural terms in this handout and be ready to use them to describe rocks in next week’s lab.
A. Task 1 - IN LAB Thin section Analysis 
Study the minerals olivine and biotite in thin section and fill out the assignment below.
The chart below indicates what thin sections contain olivine and biotite.
Thin sections referred to as "Rock Set #, Slide #” are in the rock set drawers in the back left of the lab.  
Thin sections referred to as “Book and Slide #” are in the mafic mineral book at the front right of the lab. These thin sections have a purple sticker on them. Please make sure they end up back in the mafic mineral book and NOT the rock sets!! MINERAL ROCK SET # or BOOK SLIDE # ROCK # TS # Forsteritic olivine 1 22 157 1091 Forsteritic olivine Book 1 Forsteritic olivine – with titanaugite 1 17 222 2407 Forsteritic olivine – with titanaugite Book 2 Forsteritic olivine – with titanaugite Book 3 Augite with olivine Book 4 Titanaugite – with forsteritic olivine 1 17 222 2407 Biotite  1 2 79 3523 Biotite 1 3 80 3663 Biotite 3 23 147 3530 Biotite Book 13 Biotite with haloes Book 14 
Hints/tips/directions for completing this assignment:
1. Fill the charts on the following page for each mineral you are studying. You will need to survey the thin section and look at multiple grains of the same mineral to completely describe its optical properties.
a. Remember to use the highest observed interference colour in the thin section when stating interference colour and calculating the birefringence
b. Properties that would go in the “other properties” cell would include things like pleochroic halos (if present), etc.
2. Make sure to indicate in the right hand column if you think the optic property is diagnostic or note.

B. TASK 2 Review: IDENTIFICATION OF IGNEOUS ROCKS 
Igneous rocks are classified using three properties: their mineral composition, grain size, and colour.  The igneous rock classification chart posted on Learn shows how these properties interrelate.
The column on the left hand side describes the grain size or texture of the rock.  Phaneritic rocks are composed of visible crystals (generally 1-10 mm in size).  Phaneritic rocks which have very large grains are called pegmatites.  When there are two distinct grain sizes the rock is porphyritic.  The larger crystals are called phenocrysts.  Aphanitic rocks are those fine grained rocks with crystals too small to identify with the naked eye.  These rocks may be porphyritic as well.  Oftentimes they are vesicular.  Vesicles form. during rapid cooling of the lava when gas bubbles are frozen or trapped as the lava cools.  Sometimes the lava is so full of bubbles it appears frothy and the resultant solid rock looks very spongy.  Pumice is a highly vesicular extrusive rock derived from felsic lavas.  The thin vesicle walls combined with tiny air pockets yields a rock which floats on water. Basic lavas tend to produce a highly vesicular denser material which freezes and is termed scoria, which will sink in water.  The glassy rocks have no crystalline component.  They look like glass.
The shaded portions of the upper section of the chart represent the percentage abundance of quartz, feldspars, micas, and ferromagnesian minerals in the igneous rocks.  This is the most important mineralogical information used to classify igneous rocks.  Igneous rocks composed mostly of quartz, potassium feldspar, and plagioclase are called felsic and are light coloured.  Igneous rocks composed mostly of ferromagnesian minerals are called mafic and are dark coloured.  In between the felsic and mafic rocks are the intermediate rocks which contain mixtures of both mafic and felsic minerals.  Rocks composed primarily of ferromagnesian minerals are called ultramafic rocks.  They are dark coloured.
At the very top of the chart is the colour index.  This index is the visually estimated percentage of mafic minerals in a rock. 
The procedure for identifying igneous rocks using this chart is as follows:
1. Determine the texture of the rock.
a. If the rock is coarse grained estimate the abundance of quartz, feldspars, micas, and ferromagnesian minerals.
i. Determine the colour index.  This identifies the rock as felsic, intermediate, mafic or ultramafic.  Suppose the rock was light coloured and contains 20% quartz, 40% K feldspar, 15% Na-plagioclase, 10% each of muscovite and biotite, with a minor amount of amphibole.  The shaded areas on the colour chart represent the relative proportions of each mineral within a rock.  This particular rock must be a granite (no other rock on the chart contains muscovite).  The composition of this particular granite lies on a vertical line about midway across “the granite column”.
b. If the rock is essentially fine grained the mineralogical composition will have to be inferred from the colour of the rock.  Felsic aphanitic rocks tend to be pink, white, light grey or buff coloured.  Mafic aphanitic rocks tend to be black, dark grey or dark brown.  Intermediate aphanitic rocks, as one might imagine, are somewhere in between.  The colours of these intermediate rocks may be moderate tones of grey, greenish grey, red, and brown or tan.
2. Use textural terms to name the rock.  A granite with large pink microcline phenocrysts would be called “porphyritic granite”.  A black fine grained rock with a few phenocrysts and some vesicles would be called a vesicular porphyritic basalt.
C. Task 2: How to describe hand samples 
When describing a hand sample, make sure to comment on the following six things:
1. The overall colour of the fresh surface of the rock should be described. Note the colour of the weathered surface.
2. Grain size:
a. the rock may be equigranular (equal grain sized) or porphyritic (large phenocrysts in a finer grained groundmass or matrix).
b. Phaneritic rocks may be fine-grained (grain size < 1mm), medium grained (1-5 mm), or coarse grained (grain size >5mm).
c. Aphanitic rocks may be fine-grained to glassy.
3. Mineralogy:
a. For phaneritic and porphyrtitic  rocks, determine the percentage composition of the mafic and felsic minerals in the hand specimen. Identify the major minerals, indicate the relative %  they make up of the rock and describe their size (use dimensions) and shape (hexagonal, rectanglular, etc).
b. Based on this information, record the colour index of the rock based on your percentage of mafic minerals present.
Colour Index:
leucocratic (0-33%)
mesocratic (34-66%)
melanocratic (67-100%)
c. Aphanitic rocks are too fine grained to determine mineralogy and the colour index can’t be used. Simply describe the colour of the rock.
4. Fabric/texture (the shape, spatial and inter-relationships of the minerals):
a. Describe the textures of individual minerals as well as the overall texture of the rock. Igneous minerals may be euhedral, subhedral or anhedral. The rock as a whole may be described as homogenous, porphyritic, flow-banded, vesicular, amygdaloidal, and so on…..there are many, many terms you will learn during this lab to use to describe rocks.
5. Specific gravity:
a.  Learn to judge, and record, the specific gravity of the rock as being high, medium or low.
6.  Finally, give the rock a good petrological name.
